# Code Formatting #

TODO: Currently much of the code needs to be re-formatted

# Comments #

Every function and class should have a python docstring using triple double
quotes. Eg:
    def func():
        """ This is the function documentation """
        pass

# Strings #

Use double quotes unless a string contains a double quote, then use a single
quote. If a string contains both forms of quotes, use a double quote.
